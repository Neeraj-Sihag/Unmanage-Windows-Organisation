# üõ† Unmanage-Windows-Organisation

Remove the restrictive "managed by your organization" message from Windows settings with this script. This tool automates the deletion of specific registry keys, restoring user control over system settings.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was created based on a solution shared by [Jonas The Swedish Goth](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/some-of-these-settings-are-hidden-or-managed-by/0f43eb7c-b01b-4615-8cf7-db047ac044aa) on the Microsoft Community forum, addressing issues where Windows incorrectly shows "managed by your organization" on personal devices. This script resolves the issue by removing leftover policies in the registry.
